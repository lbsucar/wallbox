==========
The use of the standard library is always a win win because it solves small problems to the developer.
This solutions prevent the developer of adquiring technical debt and also makes the software more reliable.
Also we have to remember the advantages of productivity.

Also a great practice is the use of boost libraries, but I only recommend them when they acquire a status of maturity.

In std we have:
Containers: Allow to contain objects and data.
Iterators: They allow to recover data from the containers.
Algorithms: Helps us working with the data from the containers or variables.
Functors: Are an object class that works as functions.
Utilities: Small functions that solves small problems.
Adaptors: Helps us making easy to manipulate on kind of data to another.
Allocators: Allow the memory allocation to be easy. So we can allocate resources for new objects.
Polymorphic allocators: Help also with the memory resources in case we need it to be more dynamic using pure virtual methods.
